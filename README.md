# Arduino-Projects

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects, each designed with practical applications and easy implementation in mind. The goal is to provide useful, well-documented code and explanations to help you easily set up and understand each project.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1 - Temperature and Humidity Sensor  
**Folder**: `Temp & Humidity Sensor`  
In this project, you'll learn how to use the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Temp_Humidity_Sensor_1.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, and how the code works.

### Project 2 - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor  
**Folder**: `Ultrasonic Distance Sensor`  
In this project, you'll learn how to use an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an object and display it on an I2C LCD screen. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Ultrasonic_Distance_Sensor.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, and how the code works.

### Project 3 - People Counter Using Ultrasonic Sensor  
**Folder**: `Ultrasonic People Counter`  
This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to count the number of people passing through a specific area. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Ultrasonic_People_Counter_3.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, and how the code works.
