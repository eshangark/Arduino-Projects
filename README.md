# Arduino-Projects

This repository contains a collection of Arduino projects, each designed with practical applications and easy implementation in mind. The goal is to provide useful, well-documented code and explanations to help you easily set up and understand each project.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1 - Temperature and Humidity Sensor  
**Folder**: `Temp & Humidity Sensor`  
In this project, you'll learn how to use the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Temp_Humidity_Sensor_1.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, and how the code works.

### Project 2 - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor  
**Folder**: `Ultrasonic Distance Sensor`  
In this project, you'll learn how to use an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an object and display it on an I2C LCD screen. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Ultrasonic_Distance_Sensor.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, and how the code works.

### Project 3 - People Counter Using Ultrasonic Sensor  
**Folder**: `Ultrasonic People Counter`  
This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to count the number of people passing through a specific area. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Ultrasonic_People_Counter_3.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, and how the code works.

### Project 4 - Morse Code Translator  
**Folder**: `Morse Code Translator`  
In this project, you’ll learn how to implement a Morse code translator using an Arduino and buttons. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Morse_Code_Translator_4.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, how the code works, and how to input Morse code for translation.

### Project 5 - Timer Display with Active Buzzer  
**Folder**: `Timer Display Active Buzzer`  
In this project, you’ll create a countdown timer with minute and second adjustments using three buttons. The time is displayed on an I2C LCD display. An active buzzer is used to signal when the timer reaches zero, and the display shows a “Timer Over!” message. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Timer_Display_Active_5.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, how the code works, and how to control the timer and buzzer.

### Project 6 - Timer Display with Passive Buzzer  
**Folder**: `Timer Display Passive Buzzer`  
This project is similar to the Timer Display with Active Buzzer but replaces the active buzzer with a passive buzzer. The passive buzzer plays a melody when the timer reaches zero. The project includes:
- The Arduino code (`Timer_Display_Passive_6.ino`)
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the components used, wiring connections, how the code works, and how the passive buzzer creates a melody when the timer ends.
